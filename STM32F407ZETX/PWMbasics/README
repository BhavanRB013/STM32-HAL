PWM USING HAL

	1. create new project and select STM32F407ZET
	2. in configuration go to system core -> sys -> serial wire
						rcc -> crystal/ceramic 
	3. in clock configuration give input frequency as 8 ->HSE ->PLLCLK
-> 168 IN HCLK -> APB1 AS 42
	4. in categories -> timers -> TIM14 -> activated -> PWM CHANNEL CH1
-> prescalar as 419 (420) -> mode as PWM mode 2
	5. save it and generate the code
	6. in main file write down the code for pwm
