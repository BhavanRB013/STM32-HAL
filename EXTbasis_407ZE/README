EXTI USING HAL

STM32F407ZGTX

In the configuration setup
	1. setting PF9 & PF10 as GPIO output. Built in led reference from schematic
	2. setting PE3 & PE4 as GPIO EXT3 & EXT4 as external interrupt 

	3. in categories system core -> GPIO -> modify the gpio
		I) for button select falling edge trigger and pull up. give some user label
		II)for led select HIGH as output level and leave as it is with a label
	4. system core -> NVIC -> to set priority for external interrupt
		I) 0 is the highest priority
		II) giving EXTI4 as high priority than EXTI3
	5. save it and generate code

In Project
	1. core -> source -> main.c
	2. refer the GPIO info from Drivers -> STM32F4xx_HAL_DRIVER -> src -> gpio.c
	3. we write our main code inside a callback function not in while() as whenever an external interrupt occurs
the function get called.
	4. There is a little problem as due to switch press the pulse consider we pressed for two or more times due to the speed of 
the device due to this in gpio.c we change the order of IRQHandler function. 1st - callback 2nd - clear_it
	5. save it and build the project
